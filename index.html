                    <br>
                    <p>A collaboration between myself and a few of my peers!
                        <br>
                        Everyone designed their own mini games and commited them to this larger project!
                        <br>
                        Mine is an 8-bit style Turn Based RPG. Currently an ongoing work in progress.
                        <br>
                        To Access my mini game, click the 'd' key on your keyboard at the start menu.
                        <br>
                        I advise using different strategies depending on which NPC you are fighting.

                    <p>My passion for video games and coding blend together!

                        I update this as I learn new tricks to coding!
                        <br>
                        This website is sort of my "demo" site where I try experiment with new code.
                        <br>
                        The design is that of a online video game forum where users can view the video game news, what's trending etc.
                        <br>
                        As well as view the new upcoming video games scheduled for release soon per console.

                    <p>This is the original portfolio website I had made.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        The time difference between the two is approximately six months.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was testing with linear gradients and different hover animations such as rotate and scale on the nav.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At the time I didn't have too many works too display on the portfolio.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It's a nice piece for me personally to have here to hold as a icon of progression.

                        <p>
                            This project was an modeled as an entry to the One Club For Creativity Client Brief Competition.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The client was Brooks Sports.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The client brief stated that their target audience is “younger runners”mainly, millennialsthat are already “dedicated”runners.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The project consists of three subway poster advertisements.

                    <br>
                    <p>A simple p5.js game I created.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Inspired from games such as Galaga and Space Invaders.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Space Cadet is video game in which the user controls a "spaceship" (ellipse) with the use of their mouse.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The goal is for the user to survive as long as they can and achieve a high score by dodging the "alien king's minon's" (rectangles).
